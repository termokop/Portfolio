    <div class="info-about-me">

        <p>Throughout my life, I've explored various professions while on a journey of self-discovery. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in physics education and worked as an assistant at my university, gained experience in the cinema industry, served in the Ukrainian army, managed a store, worked as a factory laborer, and even spent time in the hospitality sector.</p>
    
        <p>In all of these roles, I found myself constantly seeking solutions to the challenges presented to me. While the problems I encountered varied greatly, I noticed a common thread â€“ many of them could be effectively addressed through coding.</p>
    
        <p>This realization led me to embrace a new path in life as a developer. I am passionate about problem-solving, and I believe that coding is a versatile tool that can be applied to tackle a wide range of issues. It is my mission to harness this skill to create innovative solutions and make a positive impact on the world.</p>
    
        <p>I look forward to leveraging my diverse background and experiences to contribute meaningfully to the world of technology and development.</p>
